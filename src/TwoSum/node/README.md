# Test Execution (Node.js)

To run the Node.js unit tests in this project, ensure the following prerequisites are installed and properly configured.

---

## 1. Node.js and npm

- **Required**: Node.js 16+ and npm (Node Package Manager)
- **Check if installed**:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

- **Install if missing**:
  - **macOS** (with Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```
  - **Windows/Linux**:
    Download and install from: [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies defined in `package.json`, including testing libraries like Jest or Mocha.

---

## 3. Running the Tests

To run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This assumes you have a test script defined in `package.json` like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

You can customize the test command to use any framework, such as Mocha, Jest, or Vitest.

## 📁 Typical Project Structure

```text
my-node-project/
├── package.json
├── src/
│   └── mycode.js
└── tests/
    └── mycode.test.js
```

Make sure test files are named using the `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js` convention and are located in the `tests/` directory or alongside source files.
